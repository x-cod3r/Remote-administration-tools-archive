Xploit supports console-based plugins.

Commands:
/load <pluginname> -> trys to load a dll (plugin) with the specified name (if another dll is active, it 			will be unloaded before).
/unload -> unloads the current dll manually
/exe -> executes a function of the current dll
/upload <pluginname> -> uploads a .dll from the plugin/ folder of the Xploit directory to the servers
			directory
/showplugins -> shows all .dll files in the plugin/ directory
/help -> show this text



Coding own plugins:
you need:
- a compiler that compiles .dll files

Rules:
- Every function must return a string (this string will be sended to the client after execution)
- Every plugin must have a start() function that is called when the dll is loaded, it has no parameters.
- All funtions, except the start() function must have 1 parameter with type string (even if its not used),    this parameter can be handed over by the client.

Finished? Put the .dll into the plugin/ folder and upload it to your server!


Warning: Never try to load and use other dll's (user32.dll, kernel.dll) this could cause runtime errors.
