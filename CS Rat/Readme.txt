1) Short Introduction

Xploit is an advanced remote adminstration tool, wich is able
to get trough the most hardware/software firewalls. You will be able to
completely control an unlimited number of connected computers, that you own.

2) Quick start

- Open the Client
- Click create server
- Connect IP/DNS: Enter YOUR Ip or dns, for example 127.0.0.1 or lala.dyndns.org
- Filename when installed: make shure it ends with .exe or the Server wont work
- Port (Main): the Main-Port for the connection (Commands, directories..., change the Client port to this port or the 	       connection won't work)
- Port (Filetransfer): The port for Filetransfers
- Dll Filename: the .dll that includes the server Code, make shure it ends with .dll
- Injection: You can inject your code in a specified path or the standard application
	     for an extension (firewall bypass), for example "html", the server is injected to iexplore.exe 
	     or firefox.exe
- Melt Server: Deletes the clicked server (not the installed one)
- startup message: lets you create a messagebox on startup of the server
- Add Kbytes: add a specific number of bytes at the end of the server.0
- click "Build"
- Once you createt the server, run it on the Computer you like to control
- a message should appear in Xploit and an list entry with the name, ip,... of the remote pc should appear.
- now you have full control over this computer, click right mouse to open the menu.
- finished :)
