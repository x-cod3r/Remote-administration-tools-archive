You can change icons by going into the /com/redpois0n/icons/ folder
in the Client.jar archive while it is not running, and replacing
the .png icons.

An example would be for replacing the main jRAT icon, is to
go into the /com/redpois0n/icons and replacing icon.png to
your own icon. Prefered size 16x16.

Feel free to create theme packs.
