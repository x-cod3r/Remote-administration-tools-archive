Mutex (Only allow one instance)

Enable Mutex: Select this option to ensure that only one instance of the server is allowed to connect. This will create a socket at the selected port and occupy it thus preventing dual connections.

Mutex Port: Default is 1334. Select the port you wish to use, it is a good idea to use a port that is rarely used. To randomly select a port, select the arrows button to the right of this field to generate a random port number.
