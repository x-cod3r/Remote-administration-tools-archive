This is where you will configure how your jRat server starts and updates.

Start server with os boot: This will do just as it says. If desired, place a "check" in this box.

Drop in: Select the desired location you wish the jRat Server to drop/be placed. 


Dropped file and reg key name: Specify what you would like the dropped file to be named. (rundll32 by default).

Melt dropper after it has been run: Select this option if you wish the dropped file to delete itself after it has ran.

*Note: Reg key name has to be the same if you are updating.
