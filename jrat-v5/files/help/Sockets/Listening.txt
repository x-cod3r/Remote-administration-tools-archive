When you are adding a socket, also
known as a port to listen on, you go to
the sockets tab, which is on the main frame,
and press add socket.

Then, name the socket something if you want to,
the default name is "Socket" and some random numbers right to that.
You select what port to listen on, and the socket timeout,
which is default 15. <font color="#ff0000">Dont go under 5 seconds</font>

You select what pass and encryption key to use, then press listen and it should start
listen on that port.

Make sure you add the same values for port , pass and encryption key as you used to create your server . Otherwise your jRat server will not be able to connect to the client .
