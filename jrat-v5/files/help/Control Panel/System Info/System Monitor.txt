The System Info tab displays a small graph in the center of the screen, 
where the amount of RAM which the server is using on the host's PC. 
This can be enabled after selecting the 'Active RAM monitor' checkbox towards the bottom. 
You can also change the display type of the data, either 'Lines' or 'Dots'. 
The last choice that you have in terms of customisation is the ability to 
change the colour of the lines/dots depending on your selection, 
excluding how often the data is collected (set using the 'Interval' slider).
