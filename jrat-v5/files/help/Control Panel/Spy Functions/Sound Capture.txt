This allows you to detect any sound being 
picked up by the host's microphone. To start 
picking up sound, select the start button, and 
to stop the feature, click the 'stop' button which 
is located next to the start button. The drop down list 
on the far right allows you to adjust the quality of the recording. 
A lower quality setting is recommended for slower internet connections.
