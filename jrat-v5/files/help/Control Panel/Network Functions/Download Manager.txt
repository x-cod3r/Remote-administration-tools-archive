Download Manager:
This feature allows you to download any file from the internet into the
host's PC, and gives you the option of executing it on download. The
execution option can be enabled by checking the 'Execute' tickbox next
to the text field labelled URL. In the URL text field, you enter the URL
in which you want the file to be downloaded from. The Drop Dir: dropdown
menu allows you to choose the location for the file to be downloaded, and
once all the options have been specified you can go ahead and download the
file with the 'Download' button on the bottom right.
