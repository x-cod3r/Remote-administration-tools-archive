A popular feature on many remote administration tools, 
this allows you to create a fake alert that pops up on the host's screen. 
A number of possible icons are included, and you are able to choose a message 
title to go along with the custom message that is displayed when you press the 
'Send' button. If you want to check what the message will look like once you send it, 
you can press the test button. This will force the message to be shown on your own PC 
screen - as if someone was doing it to you.
