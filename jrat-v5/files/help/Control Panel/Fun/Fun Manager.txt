This is the key hub for the options of using the server 
to play around with the host's PC. From this page you can 
open any website a number of times, play sound from a certain 
location for any amount of time, turn on the crazy mouse button
which will cause the mouse to spin out of control, and move about irrationally, 
as well as the Beep option which is fairly self explanatory.
