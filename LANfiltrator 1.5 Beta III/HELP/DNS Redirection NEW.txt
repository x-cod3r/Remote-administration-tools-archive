----Dns Redirection Explained----
---------------------------------

Ok, lets take a look at what dns redirection is, and why anyone would use it.
First of all, whenever you connect to the internet, you're assigned an
ip address by your isp, USSUALLY you get a diffrent one everytime, this
system is called Dynamic IP allocation.
So summarized, everytime you connect to the internet, you get a diffrent
ip address.

SOME people are lucky enough to be assigned the same IP address everytime.
This system is called Static IP allocation, lots of cable and adsl providers let you have a dynamic IP.
Summarized: You always have the same IP address. (and you dont need to read on)

Most trojans work on a very simple concept:
You, the client, connect to a server/trojan, the victim.

Lanfiltrator works in a diffrent way, (explained in another text file included in the help folder).
The server connects to the client.

Now, for the server to connect to you, it needs to know your ip address, and since you have a
dynamic ip address, it constantly changes and this is going to be a problem.

This is where DNS redirection comes in.

It allows you to bind your IP address, whether it changes or not, to a never-changing
hostname, like inter.mine.nu
These hostnames are offered free of charge by companies like

http://www.mine.nu/
http://www.no-ip.com/

So that anyone connecting to this hostname will be redirected to your real ip address.

Now you may ask, How does no-ip.com know what my real IP address is, and redirect to it?
Well, for no-ip to know your ip address you have to run its client software.
The client software 'pings' the no-ip database every 10 minutes with your real ip address.
So that whenever someone connects to your domain, dns2go will ask its database for you ip address.

----How to use DNS redirection?----
-----------------------------------

Well, firstly, you'll need to download the client software from one of the aforementioned
companies, I prefer http://www.no-ip.com/.

After you've downloaded and installed the client, you'll need to sign up for a free account.
Once you've done that you just fill in that domain name, eg: inter.no-ip.com
whenever LanFiltrator asks for your IP address :)

Keep in mind that you have to run the client whenever you want to activate the DNS redirection, 
cause the client will update your IP address on the dns2go database.

I hope this little help file has enlightened you ;)
