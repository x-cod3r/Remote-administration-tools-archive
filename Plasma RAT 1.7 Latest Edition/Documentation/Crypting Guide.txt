Plasma RAT Encryption Guide / Updated on 12/8/2015

So lets get started: 
Encrypting Plasma RAT is easier than you think, if you know how it's done! 

[==============================================]

First, lets get a couple things out of the way: 

Q. Will a native crypter work with Plasma RAT? 
A. No. Even with .NET support Plasma doesn't work with native encryption software. 

Q. Will any .NET crypter work with Plasma RAT? 
A. Almost, any .NET crypter with self injection will work (Ex: Kazy Crypter)
