<a name="About"><center><font size="4"><hr color=blue>About</center></font><br>
PEST v4.0 is a remote client & server. It connects to a computer over a TCP/IP network (ie the Internet). To connect, the target computer must be running the server part of the PEST program. The server runs when windows starts up and is undetected by (most) virus scanners. PEST is one of the best Server & Client programs. Once you have connected with PEST, you have access to the remote computers hard disc, and a whole range of other options. You have full control over the victims PC! You can control the mouse, you can control nearly all aspects of the Windows O/S. You can open/close CD-ROM, you can get their saved passwords, you can get their computer info, you can change windows colors, you can send a messagebox, you can chat with your victim, you have full control over shutdown, you can even view the remote screen, and you can do much much much more!&nbsp;
<br>
(This is not the what the program was built for (i.e. hacking) but it is fun and
you should only do it when the other user agrees that you can connect to their PC -
Genoshin-GX)</a><p>
</a>
<A name="GettingStarted"><center><font size="4"><hr color=blue>Getting Started</font></center><br>
Before you begin to use PEST, you must understand that the software is
beta-class, and as such is provided as-is and is not supported. The PEST team
cannot take any responsibility for any damages to software, hardware or persons
through use of this software. Use at your own risk!<br>
<br>
First off, locate the file that you downloaded from </a> <a href="http://www.pesty.cjb.net" target="_blank">www.pesty.cjb.net</a> or any other site. Now extract the files using <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a> or another compressed archieve extractor, if you haven't done so yet. Then open the folder that you extracted the files to. Now look at all the files and you should have these files:<br>
<ul type="circle">
<li>PEST v4.exe</li>
<li>Server.exe</li>
<li>Windows XP server.exe</li>
<li>EdtSrv.exe</li>
<li>Portscan.exe</li>
<li>Help.html</li>
</ul>
If you do not have any of the above files, you can download the full zipped version from the official site at <a href="http://www.pesty.cjb.net">www.pesty.cjb.net</a><br>
Once you are sure you have all of the above files, you need to go over all the files and check what they do.<br>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Edtsrv-This edits the server that your going to infect the victim with.</li>
<li>Portscan-Is a port scanner.</li>
<li>Server-This is what receives commands from the client and you infect your victim with it.</li>
<li>Help-This is the help file.</li>
<li>Legal-This is the legal information file.</li>
<li>update notes-This is the misc notes file.</li>
</ul>
Now that you know what every file does, open Edtsrv.exe. Now, goto open and browse to the server.exe and select it. Now click on Read server settings. Then you can modify the servers settings:<br>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Enable ICQ Notify</li>
	<li>UIN</li>
	<li>Server Port</li>
	<li>Server Filename</li>
	<li>RegistryKeyname</li>
	<li>Upload/Download Port</li>
	<li>Install Directory</li>
</ul>
This is what each option does:<br>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Enable ICQ Notify-Pages you the victims IP via ICQ everytime the victim comes online.</li>
	<li>UIN-This is your ICQ number (required if Enable ICQ Notify is enabled)</li>
	<li>Server Port-This is the main port that the server is on. Example: 11831 (Required to connect)</li>
	<li>Server Filename-The name of the server after its installed on the victims computer, don't make it easy to guess its a Trojan like: Trojan.exe lol use something like mshtml.exe ;-)</li>
	<li>Registry Keyname-This is the name of the key in the registry from where the server starts with windows.</li>
	<li>Upload/Download Port-This is the port so you can view,delete,upload,download files on the victims computer. Example: 29559 </li>
	<li>Install Directory-This is the place where the server is installed after it is opened. System directory is: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ Windows directory is: C:\WINDOWS\ This is not really important.
</ul>
Now Fill Out The Server Settings After Your Done Click On Save new settings. Now you need a victim to infect. This is the hard and yet fun part.
<br><br>
<b>Using MSN messenger to get a victim:</b><br>
MSN messenger is one of the best ways of infecting a victim. You just need to find someone on your
contact list, and use 'send file or photo' to send them the 'server.exe' file. Don't forget:<br>
<b>You can rename the server file to anything you like, as long as the filename ends .exe (e.g. call it mypic.exe)</b>
<br>Unless you choose ICQ notify in the server settings, you will need to get the victims IP address. This is usually the tricky part. <br>
Take a look at <a href="#getIP">Getting an IP address - by MonkeyCircus</a> for information on how to get their IP.

<br><br>
<b>Using a chat room:</b><br>
There are many strategys for infecting people in chat rooms. By far the best is to pretend to be a girl (unless you are a girl) 
and trick the victim into accepting the file, telling them that it is a picture of you. Pretending your a girl might sound gay, but it nearly always works.
The basic trick is to ask people in the chat room to cyber with you on MSN messenger or AOL messenger etc. And then send them the file over that program.
Refer to 'Using MSN messenger to get a victim' for more information.<br><br>

Once they hve recieved and run the file (The file must be run!) then you can connect. Find the file PEST v4.exe and run it. This will open up the client on your cmoputer. When the client is open, select the text box at the top left, where it says 'IP:' and type in the victims IP address. 
You may also change the ports if you did not use 11831 and 29559. Now, click the connect button (below the IP text box). When the status bar at the very bottom of pest says 'Connected' then you have complete control over the remote computer.<p><br>

<A name="getIP"><hr color=blue><b><font size="4">How to get an IP address - by MonkeyCircus</font>&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
There are many ways of getting an IP address. I will explain here a few ways to get an IP from your victim.<br><br>
<b>Method 1.) Netstat - Old reliables.<br>
</b><br>
Netstat is by far the most reliable way of getting an IP address. Heres how to use it:<br>
In windows, goto start>programs>MS-DOS prompt. You will see a black DOS box appear. You should see something similar to this: C:\WINDOWS\ and a blinking cursor. When your connected to the internet, type in:<br>
netstat -n<br>
and press enter. If it works, you will see a list of all the IP's your currently connected/connecting to (if you get a response: bad command or file call, then you cant use this method of getting IPs, skip this method and have a look at some others). 
Now, if your using a instant messaging service to send the victim the server (e.g. MSN messenger or yahoo! messenger etc.), you can use netstat to find out their IP. WHILE the server is sending to the victim, goto dos and type:<br>
netstat -n<br>
The list of IP's will appear. The victims IP is one of the addresses under the foreign coloum. REMEMBER: YOU MUST DO THIS WHILE THE FILE IS STILL SENDING! Now, how can you tell which is your victims? The simple and obviouse way is to wait until they have the file and then go through each IP in pest until you get a connection. An advanced user wont need to do this. Advanced users can easily spot the address, becuase of either the connection status, the prefix of the address or the port that the address is on. You dont need to confuse yourself with that though.<br>
IMPORTANT NETSTAT NOTE: When you copy down the IP address from netstat, DONT COPY the colon and any numbers after the colon. The colon and numbers after it represent a port. For example: if netstat says 125.63.624.747:6891 then the IP address is 125.63.624.747<br><br>
<b>Method 2.) The easy way - "the picture doesn't work' method ;-)<br>
</b><br>
This method is not very reliable, but is by far the simplest way. If you have told your victim that the server is a picture (hehe), then you can use this method. 
Basically, when the victim runs the server, it will appear to them that nothing has happened. 
So, they will probably say something to you like: 'It doesnt work'. WHen they say this, say: 'oh, i know whats wrong, it does this on my computer sometimes. Goto start>run and type in winipcfg and click ok. Then tell me the number next to where it says IP address and I will fix it for you.'
If they fall for that, then they should tell you their IP. HA! (In XP use: Go to
start -&gt; Programs -&gt; dosprompt (where paint is) then type IPconfig -
Genoshin-GX)<br><br>
<b>Method 3.) ICQ and UIN<br>
</b><br>
If you have ICQ, you can edit the PEST server (as explained earlier in this help file) so that when they connect to the internet, the server pages you their IP address. This is an easy method and is already explained earlier in this help file, so thats all i need to say.<br><br>
<b>Method 4.) IRC scripts<br>
</b><br>
The best way of getting an IP is from IRC. Just type /Whois NICKNAMEHERE and the IRC server will tell you their IP or host name.
Usually like this: NICKNAME@223-532-646-243.aol.ipt.com <br>
If there is no visible IP address, open a DOS box (like in netstat) and type<br> <b>PING thestuffafterthe@here</b> <br>and it will reveal the correct IP.

<center><A name="batch"><hr color=blue><b><font size="4">Using the Batch Editor - by MonkeyCircus</font>&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
</a></center>
<b>What is the Batch Editor?</b>
<br>The batch editor is a tool which allows you to write a mini-program and execute it immediatly on the remote computer.<br><br>
<b>What is a Batch File?</b><br>
A Batch File is a file which contains a list of DOS commands. 
When you run the file, Windows will open a DOS prompt and execute the list of commands automatically. 
The file uses basic dos commands, some examples of DOS commands are given in the example code in the PEST v4 client.
<br><br>
<b>Why is this usefull?</b><br>
This is usefull becuase it will allow you to run several commands very, very quickly. It also allows you to create your own addon functions for PEST.<br>
<br><br>
The batch editor has thousands of possible uses, use your imagination. 
<br><br>
<b>Example code</b><br>
There is an example in the PEST v4 client, but here is another quick program sample. This one backs up the directory 'pesttest' and then deletes the original.<br><br>
@ECHO OFF<br>
ECHO Now backing up c:\pesttest to c:\pesttestbk<br>
Copy c:\pesttest\ c:\pesttestbk\<br>
ECHO Back up complete, now deleting original directory<br>
Del c:\pesttest\<br>
ECHO Task completed,<br>
PAUSE<br>

<a name="aboutserver">
First we will start with </a> <a href="?#server1info">Server #1</a><br>
Then we will goto <a href="?#serverXPinfo">Windows XP server</a><br>

<p>
<A name="server1info"><center><b>Server #1</b></center><br>
This is the windows 9x compatible server. How the server works: When the server file is executed, it copys its self into the installation directory and adds a start-up key to the registry. Then, it opens the specified port and listens for instructions. When you connect with the client, and choose a function, the client sends a simple text message to the server. When the server recieves this message, it reacts accordingly. 
<br>
In simpler terms, this is what happens:
<br>Server recieves text message
<br>Server compares the message to its list of possible messages it can recieve
<br>The server finds a match, and executes the function. Something like this:
<br><br>
If recievedmessage = 'opencd' then
/Code to open CD here/<br><br>
That is all that the server does. It does nothing else (besides a few other start-up installation functions). Some functions also require the server to send information back to the client, but that is more complex.<br><br>
<p></a><a name="serverXPinfo"><center><b>Windows XP Server</b></center><br>
Windows XP is a very annoying product. It has many compatibility issues with the 9x build of PEST. If you want to use PEST with XP, the only viable option is to use PEST Professional, which can be downloaded in the remote administration tools section of the PEST site at <a href="http://www.pesty.cjb.net">www.pesty.cjb.net</a><font size="4"><font size=3><p>

screen is where you make a new I.E. connection).
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><U>Remote ScreenCapture</b></U></font><b><br>
<br>
Connecting</b> -The pest server is split into two parts, so if one part of the
server is shut down, you still have partial-control (some technical stuff). The
screencapture server is seperate from the other functions, so, you have to
connect again. The IP address is the same for this connection (of course :-))
All you need to do is type in the IP address of the victim and click connect. <b>ScreenCapture
Basics</b> - The purpose of screencapture is to allow you to view the victims
desktop, as they can see it on there monitor. This is one of my favorite parts
of PEST. When you connect to the screencapture server, the screen refreshes
automatically. You will now see a screenshot of the victims desktop. Hehe!<br>
<b>Refreshing the screen </b>- To update the image, click the button with the
circular arrows on. This will start a new screenshot download, and within a few
seconds, you should see the screen update. Sometimes, the screen becomes
scrambled (the reason for this is highly technical, to do with the way it
updates the image). To fix this, either reconnect to the screencapture server,
or press the button with the down arrow on (to do a complete refresh).<br>
<b>Streaming Images</b> - This will automatically update the image every few
seconds. You can choose the number of seconds between each refresh in the box
below. NOTE: setting the seconds too low will cause the screen to scramble as
explained above.<br>
<b>Disconnect</b> - This disconnects you from the screencapture server, clicking again prompts you to reconnect.<br>
<b>Save screenshot</b> - Click this button to save the screenshot to your hard
disc! So you can remember the time you hacked your friend ;-)<br>
<b>Image Options </b>-This allows you to choose the format of the image, from
the following selections:<br>
greyscale (4-bit)<br>
greyscale (8-bit)<br>
color (4-bit)<br>
color (24-bit)<br>
Greyscale (4-bit) is by far the fastest option, but has no color. Color (24-bit)
is true color, but is much slower.

<b>Look In Folders</b> - This is not required but it narrows your search down.
Supply a folder to look in.<br>
<b>Search In Subdirectory's</b> - Search in sub-directorys of the choosen search

<b>Find!</b> - This starts the search and tries to find the file you suppled.<br>

<b>Clear </b>- Clears the search results.
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><U>Remote CPU Manager</b></U></font><b><br>
<br>
Clear CMOS</b> - You know when you turn on the computer, you see all that white
writing saying detecting IDE etc. Well that is all controled by a program stored
on the motherboard called CMOS. CMOS is the computers BIOS (Basic Input Output
System). Without CMOS, the computer will do nothing at all when you turn it on,
and reairing the 'damage' is expensive. Clear CMOS will delete the CMOS program
from the motherboard. ONLY USE THIS OPTION IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING.<br>
<b>Enable CPU Beep</b> - This makes the victims computer beep like holding down
Ctrl-Alt-Del But it last forever!<br>
<b>Disable CPU Beep</b> - Disables the beep.<b><br>

<U>Matrix Emulator</U></b><br><br></font>
Mimics the scene in the file 'The Matrix' where the computer talks to neo in green writing. You can choose to allow the user to talk back. In windows 9x the black screen that appears is un-closeable and cannot be escaped.<p>
<font size=4><br><b>
<U>Remote MSN manager</U></b><br><br></font>
This allows you to partially control the remote users MSN messenger program. You can choose to sign the user out (so when they sign back in, you can read their password on the keylogger) as well as change their status.<br>
There is also a online/Offline flooder. This is a very simple tool that can be used to annoy the victims MSN contact list. When this is enabled, their status changes from online to offline and back again very quickly, causing a multi-popup box effect on all of their contacts computers. This will make them very unpopular ;-)<p>

<a name="testonpc"><font size=4><b><hr color=blue>Test It On Your PC</b> <br><br></font>
You can run the server on your own computer. The server is not lethal in anyway. You can then connect to yourself with the client using the address 127.0.0.1<br>
<b>You do NOT have to be online to test the server on yourself!</b><br>
This is for people worried about other people connecting to the system. Once you have finished testing, just goto server options in the pest client and click remove server, then, when prompted, click OK. Then the server is completly removed.

Q. Does PEST's server screw your machine up?</b><br>
A. No, all the server does is receives commands from PEST.<br><br>
<b>
Q. When I am using screencapture, the screencapture goes all scrambled and weird, whats wrong?</b><br>
A. This is becuase the screencapture client is updating the image serveral times at once. Heres how to fix the problem: press the button with the down arrow once and wait a few seconds, if this doesnt fix it, press the red-cross button to disconnect, and then reconnect to the screencapture server. Everything should now be fine :-)<br><br>
<b>
Q. When using the server on Win2000, my computer crashes when I try to shutdown, why?</b><br>

<b>
Q. Can you connect to a server offline?</b><br>
A. No, there will be no connection to the server.<br><br>
