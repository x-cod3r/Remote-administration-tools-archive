PEST V4 Remote Administration Tool

Version v4.0 notes:

Windows XP Compatibility -
The client works perfectly on Windows XP, but
there are still issues on systems running the server under windows XP. 
The older XP servers seem only to work under 'laboratory' (ie. Test) 
conditions. The server is unresponsive when people come to use it.
Most systems report a error with enumerating passwords cache, and 
mpr.dll error. I am working on this, and ill post updates on the site
to keep you up to date with the XP server development.

Windows 2000/ME Compatibility -
The server works fine on 2000 and ME until the server user attempts to 
shutdown the system. The system usually haults at this point.
To allow the machine to shutdown correctly, you will need to remove
the server from the machine (refer to server removal in the help file).

Keylogger updates:
The keylogger should now be case sensitive. The changes where 
completly server-side, so the clients keylogger functions actually 
remain intact (for backward compatibility).

Thanks for using PEST!
